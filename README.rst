===========================================
dnaio processes FASTQ, FASTA and uBAM files
===========================================

``dnaio`` is a Python 3.9+ library for very efficient parsing and writing of FASTQ and also FASTA files.
Since ``dnaio`` version 1.1.0, support for efficiently parsing uBAM files has been implemented.
This allows reading ONT files from the `dorado <https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado>`_
basecaller directly.

The code was previously part of the
`Cutadapt <https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/>`_ tool and has been improved significantly since it has been split out.

Example usage
=============

The main interface is the `dnaio.open <https://dnaio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ function::

    import dnaio

    with dnaio.open("reads.fastq.gz") as f:
        bp = 0
        for record in f:
            bp += len(record)
    print(f"The input file contains {bp/1E6:.1f} Mbp")

For more, see the `tutorial <https://dnaio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`_ and
`API documentation <https://dnaio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_.

Installation
============

Using pip::

    pip install dnaio zstandard

``zstandard`` can be omitted if support for Zstandard (``.zst``) files is not required.

Features and supported file types
=================================

- FASTQ input and output
- FASTA input and output
- BAM input
- Compressed input and output (``.gz``, ``.bz2``, ``.xz`` and ``.zst`` are detected automatically)
- Paired-end data in two files
- Interleaved paired-end data in a single file
- Files with DOS/Windows linebreaks can be read
- FASTQ files with a second header line (after the ``+``) are supported

Limitations
===========

- Multi-line FASTQ files are not supported
- FASTQ and uBAM parsing is the focus of this library. The FASTA parser is not as optimized
